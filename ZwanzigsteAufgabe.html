<p> In 1986 the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), the <br>
    Army Research Office (ARO), the National Science Foundation (NSF), and <br>
    ESL, Inc sponsored Berkeley POSTGRES Project which was led by Micheal Stonebraker.</p>

<p>In 1984, an SQL language interpreter was added to POSTGRES. And then, it <br>
    was released to the web under the name of Postgres95. By 1996, the new name <br>
    PostgreSQL was chosen for the project.</p>

<p>PostgreSQL supports four standard procedural languages (which allows the <br>
    users to write their own code which can be executed by database server)- <br>
    PL/pgSQL, PL/Tcl, PL/Perl and PL/Python.</p>

<p>PostgreSQL supports B+-tree, hash, generalized search trees(GiST) and <br>
    generalized inverted indexes (GIN). Users can also create their own <br>
    customized indexes.</p>
